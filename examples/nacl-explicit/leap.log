    solvateBox solute solvent buffer [iso] [ closeness ]

      UNIT                         _solute_
      UNIT                         _solvent_
      object                       _buffer_
      NUMBER                       _closeness_

The solvateBox command creates a solvent box around the _solute_ UNIT.
The _solute_ UNIT is modified by the addition of _solvent_ RESIDUEs.

The user may want to first align long solutes that are not expected
to tumble using alignAxes, in order to minimize box volume.

The normal choice for a TIP3 _solvent_ UNIT is WATBOX216. Note that 
constant pressure equilibration is required to bring the artificial box 
to reasonable density, since Van der Waals voids remain due to the
impossibility of natural packing of solvent around the solute and at
the edges of the box.

The solvent box UNIT is copied and repeated in all three spatial directions 
to create a box containing the entire solute and a buffer zone defined 
by the _buffer_ argument. The _buffer_ argument defines the distance, 
in angstroms, between the wall of the box and the closest ATOM in the 
solute.  

If the buffer argument is a single NUMBER, then the buffer distance is
the same for the x, y, and z directions, unless the 'iso' option is used
to make the box isometric, with the shortest box clearance = buffer. If
'iso' is used, the solute is rotated to orient the principal axes,
otherwise it is just centered on the origin.

If the buffer argument is a LIST of three NUMBERS, then the NUMBERs are 
applied to the x, y, and z axes respectively. As the larger box is created 
and superimposed on the solute, solvent molecules overlapping the solute 
are removed.

The optional _closeness_ parameter can be used to control the extent to
which _solvent_ ATOMs overlap _solute_ ATOMs.  The default value of
the _closeness_ argument is 1.0, which allows no overlap.  Smaller 
values allow solvent ATOMs to overlap _solute_ ATOMs by (1 - closeness) *
R*ij, where R*ij is the sum of the Van der Waals radii of solute and
solvent atoms.  Values greater than 1 enforce a minimum gap between 
solvent and solute of (closeness - 1) * R*ij.

This command modifies the _solute_ UNIT in several ways.  First, the 
coordinates of the ATOMs are modified to move the center of a box 
enclosing the Van der Waals radii of the atoms to the origin.  Secondly, 
the UNIT is modified by the addition of _solvent_ RESIDUEs copied from 
the _solvent_ UNIT. Finally, the box parameter of the new system (still 
named for the _solute_) is modified to reflect the fact that a periodic, 
rectilinear solvent box has been created around it.
