# Benzene/Toluene Standard State Volume Files

These are specially made files to test the restraints of YANK. 
It is 1 benzene molecule (receptor) and 1 toluene molecue (ligand) in 
a cube of volume 1660 A^3 (standard state). 

We use this system to ensure the free energy of turning on restraints 
run by simulation is close to the analytical/numerical estimate for 
that free energy contribution.
