What you don't want to see is highly concentrated replicas that do not mix at all. The graphs will show red and generate a warning if there are replicas that do not mix well.\n",

This number gives you an estimate of how many iterations it will take to equilibrate the current data. Keep in mind that this analysis only runs on the *already equilibrated data* and is therefor an esimate of how long it takes the system to relax in state and configuration space from this point.\n",

This happens when there is insufficent phase space overlap between states and the probabilty of two replicas at different states swapping configurations approaches zero. If you have set the `mixing_warning_cutoff`, many of these states will be highlighted as warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Add aditional states to your simulation near the states which are not mixing well. Provide a more gradual change of energy from the state to improve replica exchange from that state.\n",

You can try un-commenting the line `cmap = plt.get_cmap(\"Blues\")` below to get a blue-scale colormap which has a far smaller white level so you can better see the diffusion in blue. You will lose the red warning color of states with too low a swap rate, but you can always comment the line back out to see those. The warning message will stil be generated.\n",

There may be some phases which were redundant though, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it just adds more samples at the given state, but it may mean you did extra work. An example of this is *decoupling* the steric forces of a ligand once *electrostatics have been annihilated* in *implicit* solvent. Since there is no change to the intra-molecular interactions at this point and the most solvent models are based on partial charges (which are now 0), all changes to the sterics are the same state.\n",

    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, we don't need to discard initial \"unequilibrated\" data; the estimate over a very long trajectory will converge to the correct free energy estimate no matter what---we simply need to run long enough.  Some MCMC practitioners, like Geyer, feel strongly enough about this to throw up a webpage in defense of this position:\n",

    "http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/mcmc/burn.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if the initial conditions are very atypical of equilibrium (which is often the case in molecular simulation), it helps a great deal to discard an initial part of the simulation to equilibration.  But how much?  How do we decide?\n",

    "Determining equilibration in a replica-exchange simulation\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard molecular dynamics simulation producing a trajectory $x_t$, it's reasonably straightforward to decide approximately how much to discard if human intervention is allowed.  We simply look at some property $A_t = A(x_t)$ over the course of the simulation---ideally, a property that we know has some slow behavior that may affect the quantites we are intersted in computing ($A(x)$ is a good choice if we're interested in the expectation $<A>$) and find the point where $A_t$ seems to have \"settled in\" to typical equilibrium behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're interested in a free energy, which is computed from the potential energy differences, let's suppose the potential energy $U(x)$ may be a good quantity to examine.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a replica-exchange simulation, there are K replicas that execute nonphysical walks on many potential energy functions $U_k(x)$.  What quantity do we look at here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work by analogy.  In a single simulation, we would plot some quantity related to the potential energy $U(x)$, or its reduced version $u(x) = \\beta U(x)$.  This is actually the negative logarithm of the probability density $\\pi(x)$ sampled, up to an additive constant:\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, this is done by recording the number of times a replica transitions from alchemical state $i$ to state $j$ in a single iteration.  Because the overall chain must obey detailed balance, we count each transition as contributing 0.5 counts toward the $i \\rightarrow j$ direction and 0.5 toward the $j \\rightarrow i$ direction.  This has the advantage of ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting transition matrix among alchemical states are purely real.\n",

    "Interpreting the Perron (subdominant/second) Eigenvalue \n",
    "----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If the subdominant eigenvalue would have been unity, then the chain would be *decomposable*, meaning that it completely separated into two separate sets of alchemical states that did not mix.  This would have been an indication of poor phase space overlap between some alchemical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it's a great idea to monitor these statistics as the simulation is running, even if no data is discarded to equilibration at that point.  They give not only a good idea of whether sufficient mixing is occuring, but it provides a lower bound on the mixing time in configuration space.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the configuration $x$ sampling is infinitely fast so that $x$ can be considered to be at equilibrium given the instantaneous permutation $S$ of alchemical state assignments, the subdominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 \\in [0,1]$ gives an estimate of the mixing time of the overall $(X,S)$ chain:\n",

    "$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{1 - \\lambda_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
