Analysis
========

The YANK analysis tools are built around bringing in modern analysis techniques to help the user better understand
the final free energy output that you get. In theory, we could just print out
"Free energy of Binding =  XX.XXX +- Y.YYY kcal/mol," but that alone does not tell you anything about the quality of
your free energy estimate. We try to provide guides and built-in analysis to help understand the numbers YANK provides.

The analysis framework comes with a full feature API, command line auto-execution, and
`Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_ to help the user analyze their data programmatically, automatically, or
visually, depending on their choice.

To perform a simple analysis of the data generated by YANK, you can use the ``yank analyze`` facility, even when YANK is running.
