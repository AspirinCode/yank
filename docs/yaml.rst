YAML Files for Simulation
*************************

YANK now supports setting up entire simulations with easy to read and write `YAML files <http://www.yaml.org/about.html>`. No longer do you need to remember long command line arguments with many ``--`` flags, you can just write a ``yank.yaml`` file and call ``yank script --yaml=yank.yaml`` to carry out all your preparation and simulations. Below are the valid YAML options. We also have example YANK simulations which use YAML files to run.
