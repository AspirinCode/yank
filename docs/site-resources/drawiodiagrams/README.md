# YANK's Draw.io Diagram Files

The files in this folder work with [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to create the image files such as the YANK 
 thermodynamic cycle, or the restraint flowchart.
 
The draw.io service works as a plugin to Google Drive files, or can be standalone and is 100% free. The XML files here 
can be loaded into the application, edited, then re-exported to update them with the YANK git repository.

# Opening the files

1. Go to https://www.draw.io/
2. Open the XML files by either:
    * Dragging the file from a file explorer to the draw.io pane
    * Open the file through the menus on the draw.io site
    
# Updating the XML files in the Git Repo

1. Choose `File -> Export as... -> XML...` from the Draw.io menus
2. Check `Compressed`
3. UNcheck `Selection Only`
4. Name the file with a `.xml` extension
5. Select `Download`
6. Save file to the the correct location in the git repo

Do not export directly to GitHub at the moment since most of these file should be included as part of other updates.
