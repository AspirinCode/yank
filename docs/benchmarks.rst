Benchmarks
**********

The YANK benchmarks are currently being worked simulated and collected for release. Eventually, they will be
automatically generated here, but for now, their progress can be tracked on
`the yank-benchmark repo <https://github.com/choderalab/yank-benchmark>`_.

We are also working on a set of validation
simulations to ensure that YANK produces the comparable free energy estimates as previous studies. These are tracked on
`the yank-validation repo <https://github.com/choderalab/yank-validation>`_.

For now, we point to the `OpenMM benchmarks page <http://openmm.org/about.html#benchmarks>`_.
